 *
 * This file defines the headers of a library to handle my RAM cache.
 * 
 * The RAM cache is a RAM buffer between a program using records and the DB file.
 * When we want to use a record from the DB file, this library must read it from disk to RAM.
 * 
 * The RAM cache is a table of BUCKETS. Each bucket may contain one register of
 * the DB file. As it is a cache, the record contained on each bucket may change.
